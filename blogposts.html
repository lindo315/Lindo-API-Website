          Blog Post 1: Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation
        </h1>

        <h2 class="text">
          The chapter focuses on defining what data is and how it related to data visualization and
          aesthetic. This definition of data and information later helps us with understanding what
          data visualization is, provides some good and bad examples of data visualization, and
          explains the importance of it in different practices whether it's informational (easy to
          understand), or it's for scientific research.
          The chapter starts by explaining the concept of data visualization, as something that has
          been present for many years, dating back to the 2 Century AD. Where ancient civilizations
          would draw and sculpt patterns to visually represent the world around them (and
          sometimes whole cities). One good example I found was the Saint Belec slab, which is an
          artifact, believed to be a stone map of an early Bronze Age principality and is also the oldest
          known representation of a territory in Europe. Going forward, the chapter explains how the
          visual representation of data has changed due to the evolution and development of new
          technology, especially in computer sciences. And so, data visualization has developed from
          drawings and sketches to accurate representation through graphs, plots, and other forms of
          data visualization technics, in order to present accurate and easily readable data to people.
          This is what the author calls traditional data visualization, data that focuses on
          communication and understanding, making it easier for people to engage with that
          information.
        </h2>

        <h3 class="text">
          In my own understanding of the reading, data visualization is the depiction of complex data,
          sometimes data that has no meaning on its own and is derived from different sources, in an
          easy and digestible way. This can take the form of graphs, pictures/images, charts, and
          other tools used by data visualization devices like computers. Since our brains find it hard to
          make sense of raw data (because data by itself is meaningless), we come up with different
          ways to make sense of it. And so using these tools we're able to turn this data into
          information for our own understanding. The chapter touches on that as well as the author
          differentiates between data and information. Saying that primary data is raw and
          unprocessed data and information is secondary data, data that's already been processed for
          human cognitive perception and understanding. I personally liked this depiction of data and
          information. Because in order to understand further what data visualization is and how
          important it is, it is safe to say it's better to define what the term data means in this context,
          and since we usually associate data with information, sometimes the two are different by a
          certain degree. With what I've explored above, the difference between data and
          information, it's safe to say that data visualization is a bridge between data and information.
          The transformation of raw data from meaningless statistics or numbers into well-structured
          figures, graphs, and diagrams, makes it so that people see this data in a way that their minds
          can process and make sense of what they're seeing, and that is, the information they
          receive from those data visualizations.
          The author does a good job of explaining this and provides examples and diagrams. But
          there is a break up before, as the author mentions that there is information visualization
          and then there is scientific visualization. Though the two are different, they are still
          representations of data but from two different fields using different methods designed to
          relay or visualize what each field has to communicate. I believe that this segregation is
          important. Some methods are only suitable for representing scientific data and visualizing
          said data for scientists to understand and keep track of that data. Then there are
          conventional methods, those only used for visually representing abstract data just for the
          general public to understand. And since the two focus on visually representing different
          forms of data, the information they carry is vastly different, but they still fall under data
          visualization.
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text">
          There are several different forms of information visualization and scientific visualization. The
          author discusses most of them and provides different examples and pictures of them for
          better understanding. Which in itself is data visualization. To help us get a better
          understanding of the concepts the author's discussing, they provide something for us as
          readers to see in order to understand what they are talking about and what these data
          visualization examples look like.
          I believe there are other ways of visualizing data beyond the current ones mentioned in the
          reading. Some methods are used in video games as stats and attributes, and sometimes
          they're used in sports figures or competitive competitions (even horse racing). From those I
          mentioned, images can be used to visualize the source of the data and the stats become the
          information about that source's capabilities. Outside websites and sports, looking into
          gaming now, there is this game called Cyberpunk 2077. In that game data visualization
          about the player's character (their stats) can be viewed in a visually appealing way and it's
          so easy to understand. From the character's strength to their intelligence, this gives the
          player a certain understanding of what their character can and cannot do. That, I believe, is
          another form of data visualization even though fictional.
          To conclude, I believe this chapter was useful if not important for people interested in the
          field of data management, data analysis, web designers, and even content creators who
          focus on educational content that doesn't deal with complex scientific data but focuses on
          visual data they can show to their viewers, and they would understand without
          commentary. Even though the author never stuck with one definition for data visualization
          and kept breaking down different types of data and different types of that data, I found
          myself getting confused at certain times. I assumed the chapter would discuss the concept
          of data visualization, what it means (in their words), why it matters, examples of data
          visualization, and why they're unique. It did but lost me when attempting to define the term
          data visualization.

          Blog Post 2: Critical Reflection - Your proposed UI and UX
        </h2>

        <h3 class="text">
          For this website, I chose to use a single-page website with several sections housing different
          parts of the website. I made it like this because it's a method I found most pleasing and it's
          not too confusing to navigate through the website thanks to the navigation bar linking to
          each section. This makes it easier to navigate and find the right section by just engaging with
          the navigation bar. Also, since the navigation bar is crucial to the user making their way
          across the website page, I made it visible every time the user scrolls up, and when they
          scroll down or press a link in the navigation bar to a section, the bar itself disappears to the
          top of the screen, giving more space for the section to be visible, and the user to see the
          content on there without any blockade. More interface elements include the toggle button
          when the website is viewed on smaller screens, and the linked icons leading to the design
          section and blog post section (currently empty).
          For clarity and familiarity, the website uses a fixed number of elements seen in different
          sections, and each element serves either a navigation role or to communicate information
          clearly to the user. A few of these elements are the icons I used to describe graphically what
          solar flares are and how they form. I used icons and text, side by side, to illustrate how solar
          flares are created in an easy-to-follow manner. Another element I used was the div boxes
          that separate the content of the website from the background itself, it was for aesthetic
          purposes at first, but it later made sense why it looked better and read so too. Since I did
          not want to create a blend-looking website I also did not plan on making a pretty-looking
          site either, that way I could focus on communicating and visualizing the data I had without
          confusing or boring the user. Basically, it balances aesthetics and the practicality of the
          website. These div boxes make the content stand out by having a different background
          color, that way it's readable without appearing like it's glued to the main background.
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text">
          For user control, there were upsides and downsides when making it. Currently, the website
          is a one-page site and primarily relies on scrolling up and down to navigate across different
          sections. The links on the navigation bar help but on the main page, it can be hard to tell
          where the user is provided it's their first time using the website. What I mean by this is that
          each section can only rely on its title and the information it has to tell the user where they
          are on the website. I've also implemented buttons (links) for the user that connect them to
          different pages of the website, and they can easily track back to the previous page, the main
          page that is. For the blog post, when I do put it on the website, I also have a 'back to top'
          button that appears when the user scrolls down the page since the text is long. Pressing this
          button automatically scrolls the page up to the top for easy navigation.
          Hierarchy, the way I structured the website was not in the order of importance but a way to
          tell a story. The website begins with a title, basically announcing to the user that the website
          is about Solar Flares using a large font titling at the center of the landing page. Following
          that is the About section, Here I wrote a short introduction as to what the website features
          and what API is used to visualize the data it has. After, I give a short brief of what Solar
          Flares are in that same section, before continuing on with a visualization of how Solar Flares
          form and their impact on the Earth. I did that by telling a story, using icons I got online, and
          researching how these solar events form. This is useful because it gives a brief background
          on what Solar Flare is before introducing these live data visualizations about them. That
          way, users can at least have some brief background knowledge about what these solar
          events are. The section following that is the Data section, This is where I'll display the data
          visualization using the NASA API, and I'll be using two graphs to display different aspects of
          the API. And then finally, links not related to the API itself at the end, the design section, and
          the art section before closing the website with a source for every asset used in its
          production.
        </h4>

        <h5 class="text">
          Currently, I'm torn between the dark version of the website and the light version in terms of
          colors. Initially, I wanted to create the website using a darker aesthetic with bright red
          colors, but it didn't look pleasing to the eye, so I opted to use lighter colors to make it pop
          out and engaging to look at. My previous website had the same effect on my test group
          where I showed people my website when it used darker colors compared to lighter colors.
          Research from a study I saw stated that adults tend to prefer using a lighter UI as it helps
          them intuitively use the site and it's easier for the feel and theme for the website as people
          engage lighter colors as more fun and welcoming, and in websites such engagement is
          important from users. The study then compared a percentage of users who were asked
          what kind of UI they prefer, where 47% opted for a lighter UI, 10% for a darker UI, 36% said
          it depends on the site, and the other 7% didn't care.
          With the UI and background adopting lighter colors, the text had to adopt from darker
          colors to colors that range in the middle, from darker colors to lighter colors depending on
          the background. This website has a lot of information on it, but cut down in words as I used
          icons/images to help users understand said information. And so I had to cut down on how
          many words I put up, giving me enough space to use bigger fonts that would be easier to
          see.

        <h3 class="text">
          The reading introduces itself as trying to find a definite definition of the word interaction, in
          the context of data visualization or Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The authors
          acknowledge that for years now, data visualization practitioners have been trying to
          enhance interactivity within their systems but have come across issues since they didn't
          know how to apply HCI concepts to their systems. And though there has been a push for
          more interactive visualization systems to personalize visualization or annotate data a bit
          better, the authors mention an obstacle preventing this, and that obstacle is a clear
          definition of interactivity. Well in this essay, I will explore how the authors went about
          trying to define interaction and use my own ideas to voice my opinions on their methods
          and provide examples for them.
          But what is interaction in data visualization, well in his article, Jon Kowieski defines it as
          âInteractive data visualization is a type of data visualization that allows users to interact
          with data in order to explore and understand it.â What I understand from this definition is
          that it merges the two concepts, interaction, and data visualization to define their
          relationship in helping people understand data by engaging with it. I believe that this
          definition encompasses the basic ideas of what interaction means in data visualization as a
          whole without complicating things.
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text">
          In the reading âWhat is Interaction for Data Visualizationâ by Evanthia Dimara and Charles
          Perin, the authors start by acknowledging the challenge of establishing a clear difference
          between HCI and data visualization, emphasizing the importance of a well-defined concept
          to make sense of both concepts for the sake of innovation (finding new ways to represent
          and visualize data in new ways). With that in mind, they then outline several key distinctions
          that are vital to comprehending interaction in data visualization. These distinctions
          encompass the entities at play, the focus on performance, the nature of intent, the
          integration of intent, and flexibility within the tool. For the entities at play, the authors
          discuss the concept that data visualization introduces a third entity into the traditional HCI
          paradigm. Instead of just the human-computer interplay, it involves data as a crucial entity
          too. The authors state, "In visualization, this folk notion differs in that it must include a data
          entity. The entities engaged in an interplay of sorts would then be (data, computer, human),
          with the computer being a mediator between human and data." In my take, this is obviously
          important. In order to relay data to the human eye for easier understanding, the computer
          is crucial in manipulating that data by displaying it in a visually appealing manner.
          Also, the difference in the focus of performance between HCI and data visualization is a
          critical factor to take note of. Though HCI often aims to minimize user effort and maximize
          performance, data visualization aims to engage users in a process of easier understanding of
          data. This in itself means that, in data visualization, good interaction does not always mean
          effortless interaction; it can sometimes involve deliberate efforts to gain a greater
          understanding of the data, making it an even more complicated process for interaction for
          the sake of proper understanding of the data. Moving on to the nature of intent in data
          visualization, we are presented with another dimension of differentiation. In traditional HCI,
          user intent tends to be task-oriented, with clear goals for interaction. Data visualization
          expands on this perspective in a way that it acknowledges that user intent can encompass a
          wide array of motivations, ranging from analytical tasks to emotional responses when
          engaging with artistic data (D3.Js, sometimes). The idea of data visualization at the end of
          the day revolves around data-related intent, making it unique in the HCI landscape. Its
          interaction also does not involve just user intent, but it unfolds as a dynamic process where
          goals and intentions evolve throughout the interaction cycle. It's a more fluid, less rigid form
          of intent compared to the structured, predetermined goals of HCI. I believe this flexibility is
          important in distinguishing data visualization since it challenges traditional HCI concepts by
          being less rigid and robotic.
        </h4>

        <h5 class="text">
          The authors later explore the idea that data visualization necessitates flexibility within the
          tool itself because users may need to switch tasks during interaction. They suggest,
          "Interacting with a visualization often results in changing tasks on the fly, to iteratively build
          an understanding of the data through a series of smaller data questions." This in itself shows
          the importance and the requirement for flexibility within the tool in data visualization,
          differentiating it from the more view-centric interaction of HCI. I liked exploring this idea of
          flexibility because of how common it is on data visualization websites and applications
          because of their uses. For example, imagine you're using a data visualization tool to explore
          a large dataset that contains information on worldwide weather patterns. Your initial intent
          is to analyse the temperature changes over time, focusing on a specific region. As you
          interact with the visualization, you realize that the data reveals not only temperature trends
          but also rainfall patterns, wind speeds, and atmospheric pressure. But in a traditional HCI
          setting, where the interaction is often task-driven and view-centric, you might find it difficult
          to shift your focus to these additional aspects of the data. The tool may have predefined
          views and interactions tailored to temperature analysis, making it less flexible to
          accommodate your evolving intentions.
          The author's discussion about flexibility leads to an interesting idea of interaction means.
          Meaning that it encompasses the idea that the quality of interaction is influenced by the
          range of distinct controls a data interface provides for users to perform actions. These
          interaction means can range from basic to sophisticated, and form the toolkit that users
          wield to interact with data. And so, a flexible data interface is one that provides a wide
          range of different interaction means to its users, enhancing the quality of interaction. This
          concept allows data interfaces to accommodate users with different preferences, needs,
          and abilities. But more interaction means don't necessarily equate to a better interface, like
          I mentioned before. The key is to strike the right balance that empowers users without
          overwhelming them. To bring these theoretical discussions down to practicality, the authors
          introduce the operationalization of flexibility within a data interface. They outline a
          straightforward way to assess and compare data interfaces, considering the number of
          distinct allowable actions a person can perform and the number of interaction means
          available for each action. This operationalization provides a much-needed bridge between
          theory and real-world application. It allows us to evaluate existing tools, making sure they
          meet the needs and expectations of users.
        </h5>

        <h6 class="text">
          In conclusion, interaction in data visualization is an evolving field and serves as the gateway
          for users to engage with data through different visualization techniques and gain deeper
          insights into said data. And as the volume and complexity of data continue to grow, having a
          clear definition and effective interaction in data visualization is important since it's the heart
          that empowers people and organizations to transform information into knowledge and
          enables data-driven decision-making.

          Blog Post 4: Data-Driven Artwork
        </h2>

        <h3 class="text">
          In this final website submission, the artwork I decided to present explores the range at which solar flares occur and the different classes of each occurring solar flare. The artwork aims to present this data in a visually appealing way while displaying each solar event in an artistic yet neatly structured way. I used a NASA API to fetch sets of data from each occurring solar flare, from the dates and times at which they begin, to the classes. I believe that this data is important to take note of since each occurring class (solar flare) teaches us more about the sun's behavior and what to expect from it over time. Since some solar flare classes can prove to be a threat to Earth's atmosphere and all electrical devices.
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text">
          What Is Data Art:
          In my own constructed definition, it's a creative practice that uses data sets to produce expressive, visually engaging, and often emotion-evoking works of art. Unlike traditional data visualizations, which focus on presenting data clearly and analytically, data art shifts the emphasis toward aesthetic and creative expression. It also aims to convey a narrative or elicit emotions and thoughts in its audience, often transcending the boundaries of conventional charts and graphs. This definition is a mix of external research and my way of simplifying the term in a way that I would understand. And so, I attempted to create something that falls under this definition, which proved to be challenging at first with the data I had. However, I ended up finding a way to use said data to create something similar to what the definition would present or define.

        </h4>

        <h5 class="text">
          The Creation Process:
          The API I chose is only limited to two sets of usable data, the dates of solar flare occurrences and their classes. I looked up a couple of ways to create something artistic using code while taking into consideration the data I had. I wanted to implement my API in my art, but the examples I came across were either too advanced or had nothing to do with APIs. So, I first created a colorful graph to pass as my data art, only to find out it was not considered to be artistic and was technically data visualization. With this in mind, I knew that with the little time I had left, I had to come up with something quickly. Something different and unexpected but is also visually pleasing to look at. Since I was dealing with solar flares, I wanted to create something that could visualize their power (class) and how old they are (dates at which they occurred).
          I then created solar rings with different colors depicting different occurring solar flares from the sun, and each color is how old the solar flare is. Rings that have warmer colors depict recently occurred solar flares and the oldest ones have colder colors. I wanted to make it obvious to the eyes that the solar flares range in age and using colors in that sense was one way of doing that. In my initial idea, I wanted to create a heatmap, showing older solar flares as being bluer and the latest ones being red. But I could not go forth with that plan because it would have taken time to figure it out and it was a tough process trying to make a heatmap with the data I had. 

          Inspiration:
          The diagram below shows four different illustrations of the Solar Orbiter's position. The ring illustration was something I liked and thought it would be a good idea to implement since my heatmap was not successful.
          The one below was for my initial idea, and so I decided to mix both ideas and make something entirely different and new. This diagram shows the effects of solar flares on Earth.

          Intent:
          ViÃ©gas and Wattenberg in their paper discuss the work of artists like Jason Salavon and Golan Levin, emphasizing their intent in using data for artistic purposes. Jason Salavon, for instance, explores collective human experiences through the aggregation of data, transcending the traditional boundaries of visualizations to create art. Likewise, Golan Levin uses data and visualization to encourage the exploration of cultural relationships and behavioral patterns, and so, both these artists seek to use data to create âthought-provokingâ art. In comparison, I sought to follow their principle and do something unconventional. I aimed to transform data about solar flares into a visually appealing piece that changes how we think about solar flares and the sun's behavior as a result. Just like the artists mentioned, I repurposed scientific data and techniques to create art with intent. The intent was to not just display information but to invite viewers to engage with the concept of solar flares, their class, and their age through a creative lens. This aligns with the artist's goal of guiding analytical reasoning and encouraging a new way of thinking and interpreting data.
          Conclusion:
          In the process of making my website, I believe I've finally merged solar data with the art of visualization. By encapsulating the intricacies of solar flares into visually captivating artwork, I've attempted to shed new light on these celestial events. I also believe this paralleled the intentions of artists like Jason Salavon and Golan Levin, who use data as a means to evoke thought and emotion. I aimed to do more than convey information; I wanted to encourage viewers to contemplate solar flares using the API data I chose. Much like these artists, I repurposed data with the intent to inspire, offering a unique perspective for viewers to rethink their perception of the sun's behavior and its connection to our planet.
