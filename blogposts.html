          Blog Post 1: Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation
        </h1>

        <h2 class="text">
          The chapter focuses on defining what data is and how it related to data visualization and
          aesthetic. This definition of data and information later helps us with understanding what
          data visualization is, provides some good and bad examples of data visualization, and
          explains the importance of it in different practices whether it's informational (easy to
          understand), or it's for scientific research.
          The chapter starts by explaining the concept of data visualization, as something that has
          been present for many years, dating back to the 2 Century AD. Where ancient civilizations
          would draw and sculpt patterns to visually represent the world around them (and
          sometimes whole cities). One good example I found was the Saint Belec slab, which is an
          artifact, believed to be a stone map of an early Bronze Age principality and is also the oldest
          known representation of a territory in Europe. Going forward, the chapter explains how the
          visual representation of data has changed due to the evolution and development of new
          technology, especially in computer sciences. And so, data visualization has developed from
          drawings and sketches to accurate representation through graphs, plots, and other forms of
          data visualization technics, in order to present accurate and easily readable data to people.
          This is what the author calls traditional data visualization, data that focuses on
          communication and understanding, making it easier for people to engage with that
          information.
        </h2>

        <h3 class="text">
          In my own understanding of the reading, data visualization is the depiction of complex data,
          sometimes data that has no meaning on its own and is derived from different sources, in an
          easy and digestible way. This can take the form of graphs, pictures/images, charts, and
          other tools used by data visualization devices like computers. Since our brains find it hard to
          make sense of raw data (because data by itself is meaningless), we come up with different
          ways to make sense of it. And so using these tools we're able to turn this data into
          information for our own understanding. The chapter touches on that as well as the author
          differentiates between data and information. Saying that primary data is raw and
          unprocessed data and information is secondary data, data that's already been processed for
          human cognitive perception and understanding. I personally liked this depiction of data and
          information. Because in order to understand further what data visualization is and how
          important it is, it is safe to say it's better to define what the term data means in this context,
          and since we usually associate data with information, sometimes the two are different by a
          certain degree. With what I've explored above, the difference between data and
          information, it's safe to say that data visualization is a bridge between data and information.
          The transformation of raw data from meaningless statistics or numbers into well-structured
          figures, graphs, and diagrams, makes it so that people see this data in a way that their minds
          can process and make sense of what they're seeing, and that is, the information they
          receive from those data visualizations.
          The author does a good job of explaining this and provides examples and diagrams. But
          there is a break up before, as the author mentions that there is information visualization
          and then there is scientific visualization. Though the two are different, they are still
          representations of data but from two different fields using different methods designed to
          relay or visualize what each field has to communicate. I believe that this segregation is
          important. Some methods are only suitable for representing scientific data and visualizing
          said data for scientists to understand and keep track of that data. Then there are
          conventional methods, those only used for visually representing abstract data just for the
          general public to understand. And since the two focus on visually representing different
          forms of data, the information they carry is vastly different, but they still fall under data
          visualization.
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text">
          There are several different forms of information visualization and scientific visualization. The
          author discusses most of them and provides different examples and pictures of them for
          better understanding. Which in itself is data visualization. To help us get a better
          understanding of the concepts the author's discussing, they provide something for us as
          readers to see in order to understand what they are talking about and what these data
          visualization examples look like.
          I believe there are other ways of visualizing data beyond the current ones mentioned in the
          reading. Some methods are used in video games as stats and attributes, and sometimes
          they're used in sports figures or competitive competitions (even horse racing). From those I
          mentioned, images can be used to visualize the source of the data and the stats become the
          information about that source's capabilities. Outside websites and sports, looking into
          gaming now, there is this game called Cyberpunk 2077. In that game data visualization
          about the player's character (their stats) can be viewed in a visually appealing way and it's
          so easy to understand. From the character's strength to their intelligence, this gives the
          player a certain understanding of what their character can and cannot do. That, I believe, is
          another form of data visualization even though fictional.
          To conclude, I believe this chapter was useful if not important for people interested in the
          field of data management, data analysis, web designers, and even content creators who
          focus on educational content that doesn't deal with complex scientific data but focuses on
          visual data they can show to their viewers, and they would understand without
          commentary. Even though the author never stuck with one definition for data visualization
          and kept breaking down different types of data and different types of that data, I found
          myself getting confused at certain times. I assumed the chapter would discuss the concept
          of data visualization, what it means (in their words), why it matters, examples of data
          visualization, and why they're unique. It did but lost me when attempting to define the term
          data visualization.

          Blog Post 2: Critical Reflection - Your proposed UI and UX
        </h1>

        <h2 class="text">
          For this website, I chose to use a single-page website with several sections housing different
          parts of the website. I made it like this because it's a method I found most pleasing and it's
          not too confusing to navigate through the website thanks to the navigation bar linking to
          each section. This makes it easier to navigate and find the right section by just engaging with
          the navigation bar. Also, since the navigation bar is crucial to the user making their way
          across the website page, I made it visible every time the user scrolls up, and when they
          scroll down or press a link in the navigation bar to a section, the bar itself disappears to the
          top of the screen, giving more space for the section to be visible, and the user to see the
          content on there without any blockade. More interface elements include the toggle button
          when the website is viewed on smaller screens, and the linked icons leading to the design
          section and blog post section (currently empty).
          For clarity and familiarity, the website uses a fixed number of elements seen in different
          sections, and each element serves either a navigation role or to communicate information
          clearly to the user. A few of these elements are the icons I used to describe graphically what
          solar flares are and how they form. I used icons and text, side by side, to illustrate how solar
          flares are created in an easy-to-follow manner. Another element I used was the div boxes
          that separate the content of the website from the background itself, it was for aesthetic
          purposes at first, but it later made sense why it looked better and read so too. Since I did
          not want to create a blend-looking website I also did not plan on making a pretty-looking
          site either, that way I could focus on communicating and visualizing the data I had without
          confusing or boring the user. Basically, it balances aesthetics and the practicality of the
          website. These div boxes make the content stand out by having a different background
          color, that way it's readable without appearing like it's glued to the main background.
        </h2>

        <h3 class="text">
          For user control, there were upsides and downsides when making it. Currently, the website
          is a one-page site and primarily relies on scrolling up and down to navigate across different
          sections. The links on the navigation bar help but on the main page, it can be hard to tell
          where the user is provided it's their first time using the website. What I mean by this is that
          each section can only rely on its title and the information it has to tell the user where they
          are on the website. I've also implemented buttons (links) for the user that connect them to
          different pages of the website, and they can easily track back to the previous page, the main
          page that is. For the blog post, when I do put it on the website, I also have a 'back to top'
          button that appears when the user scrolls down the page since the text is long. Pressing this
          button automatically scrolls the page up to the top for easy navigation.
          Hierarchy, the way I structured the website was not in the order of importance but a way to
          tell a story. The website begins with a title, basically announcing to the user that the website
          is about Solar Flares using a large font titling at the center of the landing page. Following
          that is the About section, Here I wrote a short introduction as to what the website features
          and what API is used to visualize the data it has. After, I give a short brief of what Solar
          Flares are in that same section, before continuing on with a visualization of how Solar Flares
          form and their impact on the Earth. I did that by telling a story, using icons I got online, and
          researching how these solar events form. This is useful because it gives a brief background
          on what Solar Flare is before introducing these live data visualizations about them. That
          way, users can at least have some brief background knowledge about what these solar
          events are. The section following that is the Data section, This is where I'll display the data
          visualization using the NASA API, and I'll be using two graphs to display different aspects of
          the API. And then finally, links not related to the API itself at the end, the design section, and
          the art section before closing the website with a source for every asset used in its
          production.
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text">
          Currently, I'm torn between the dark version of the website and the light version in terms of
          colors. Initially, I wanted to create the website using a darker aesthetic with bright red
          colors, but it didn't look pleasing to the eye, so I opted to use lighter colors to make it pop
          out and engaging to look at. My previous website had the same effect on my test group
          where I showed people my website when it used darker colors compared to lighter colors.
          Research from a study I saw stated that adults tend to prefer using a lighter UI as it helps
          them intuitively use the site and it's easier for the feel and theme for the website as people
          engage lighter colors as more fun and welcoming, and in websites such engagement is
          important from users. The study then compared a percentage of users who were asked
          what kind of UI they prefer, where 47% opted for a lighter UI, 10% for a darker UI, 36% said
          it depends on the site, and the other 7% didn't care.
          With the UI and background adopting lighter colors, the text had to adopt from darker
          colors to colors that range in the middle, from darker colors to lighter colors depending on
          the background. This website has a lot of information on it, but cut down in words as I used
          icons/images to help users understand said information. And so I had to cut down on how
          many words I put up, giving me enough space to use bigger fonts that would be easier to
          see.
